# Easy Containers
Skyrim mod for item management. \

Batch move unwanted items to any container.

## Usage
First you need to "mark" some items so this mod knows you want to get rid of them. 

- Put your unwanted items inside any container. 
- Make sure the game crosshair is over that container (it should appear the "Activate" message) . 
- Use "mark item" hotkey to remember those items. 
- If you get the message pop-up, your items will now be remembered. 

Those items are marked **forever**. 
If you want to add more to the Marked List, just put new items inside some container and mark them using the same steps above. 

Whenever you have Marked items in inventory, all of them will be moved to any container under the crosshair. 

- Put some container over the crosshair. 
- Press the "transfer" hotkey. 
- All Marked items will be transferred to that container.
